Hide the dashboard from your blog subscribers when they are logged in.

== Description ==

This plugin removes the dashboard link and prevents access to the dashboard for users assigned to the Subscriber role. This is useful if you want to allow your subscribers to edit their own profiles, but don't want them wandering around the rest of your WordPress admin section.

Users belonging to any of the other WordPress roles will continue to see the dashboard link and have dashboard access that corresponds to their role's capabilities.

Based on the [IWG Hide Dashboard](http://www.im-web-gefunden.de/wordpress-plugins/iwg-hide-dashboard/ "IWG Hide Dashboard") plugin by Thomas Schneider, which requires having the Role Manager plugin activated in order for it to function.

This plugin relies only on core WordPress capabilities to function.
